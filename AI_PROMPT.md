# AI Assistance Disclosure

## Tool Used
- OpenAI Codex CLI (GPT-5)

## How AI Was Used
AI was used for review and documentation polish only. It did not solve the core decoding logic or design the algorithm.
- Reviewed `OldPhonePadDecoder.cs` for rule compliance and edge cases.
- Reviewed test coverage in `OldPhonePadDecoderTests.cs` and suggested additional cases.
- Edited `README.md` for clarity, completeness, and formatting.

## Example Prompt (actual)
```
Review README.md for professional engineering standards.

Ensure it includes:
- Problem summary and rules (digits, space pause, '*', '#')
- Clear run instructions (dotnet test)
- Example I/O from the PDF
- A brief design explanation (state machine / buffering)
- Explicit AI disclosure link to AI_PROMPT.md (hyperlink)

Provide a minimal edit patch to improve clarity and professionalism without adding fluff.
